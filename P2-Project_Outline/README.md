## Submission Instructions

### Overview
It's 2022 and you decided to make some commitments and one of them happens to be changing your whole wardrobe but can’t decide where to start from until one day you scroll by lets say instagram or tiktok and find this really cute outfit but don’t know where they got it from. Even when you try messaging the person asking “Where did you get that shirt from” or “Where do you shop” you're just left unread and decide to search for the outfit yourself but in the end, you come out empty handed.

This is where my app comes into play. FindMyFit is an open app to everyone who just wants to find that outfit they’re seeking from clothing to accessories and more. Now I know, who would even want to use this at this day of age. Well teens of course. Teens are always looking for the latest fits, especially trying to show off their outfits at school just to get asked “where did you buy it”. Even adults want that perfect fit for when they go out to the city or even a date.

This idea came to me when one day my girlfriend, casually scrolling through a video from tik tok, found an outfit that this girl was wearing, asked me to buy it for her as she didn't even know where to get the outfit or even shop from, leaving me to question myself, why me. Back to the point, I spent hours looking for that shirt she wanted, frustrated, I said to myself “can’t I just screenshot this girl's outfit or something,”and this is where it all started. 

What was that you asked, how does it all work? Great question, FindMyFit works by taking a screenshot of the outfit that person is wearing or even displaying, making sure its’ fully visible of course. After a couple of seconds  the app starts pulling up similar outfits or even accessories and tells you where you’re able to purchase it from.  

### Features
Some of the key features that I'll be adding to this app would be sign up/ Login. This will play a key role for the user when it comes to user information from email address to their favorite shopping centers. This will also help when the user would like to look up any previous uploads they've made instead of going back to their gallery and looking for that specific pic from several weeks ago or so. Another major key to this app would be search, without it, how else can the app function properly. When the user does find the product they are looking for, they can find that specific product to be more affordable at other online stores or even their local shopping stores. Search will help guild the user into filtering from availability to specified name brands.
Another feature that I would love to add would be user feedback. In order for the app to progress, feedback is needed for any bugs in the app or even adding more features that should be included that were not thought of. Being able to respond to those feedback will tell the consumers that we hear them loud and clear and are working to make sure that the app provides the necessary tools for the app to succeed. 


### Technologies

Judging from the app, I will  be using Java for app development and API in order for the user to exchange island access information from other sources. I thought of using javascript but noticed that when it comes to flexibility, java is the way to go while being less prone to errors and bugs as being familiar with java also plays a key part. API (application programming interface) will help with user accessibility, serving as a door that leads to the program. API would also help transmit data faster making it easier for the user to use the app.
